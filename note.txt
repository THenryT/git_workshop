1. What is Git
  Git is the most widely used modern version control system in the world today.
  Git is Distributed Version Control System, why it be called DVCS is becuase 
  every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that 
  can contain the full history of all changes.

  Setup commands:  git init, git clone, git conig

  git init: creates a new Git repository

  git clone: git clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo 
  and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new directory, 
  at another location.
